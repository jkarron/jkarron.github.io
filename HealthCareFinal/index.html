    <p>COLLEGE PARK, Md. - More women are being diagnosed with stage 1 breast cancer since the passage of the Affordable Care Act -- and doctors and researchers say that’s a good thing.
    </p>
    <p>Under the Affordable Care Act, there are no out-of-pocket expenses for mammograms because they’re considered a preventive service.</p>
    <p>“With the Affordable Care Act, it’s really allowed more people access to mammography and the result of that is being able to diagnose women at earlier stages. When women are diagnosed at later stages, especially stage 4, surgery is often not an option for them,” said Dr. Regina Hampton, breast surgeon and medical director at Doctors Community Hospital.</p>

      <p>That’s had another effect, researchers say: More black women are getting screened.
      </p>
      <p>Twenty-four percent of those diagnosed with breast cancer after Obamacare began were black, as opposed to 21 percent before, according to the National Cancer Institute.</p>
      <p>Obamacare’s coverage of mammograms, “has now allowed women to be screened and as a result of that, detect breast cancer at an earlier stage, stage 1,”  said Dr. Mary A. Garza, assistant professor of the department of behavioral and community health and associate director at the University of Maryland Center for Health Equity.
      </p>
      <p>The National Breast Cancer Foundation’s definition of stage 1 breast cancer is: “contained to only the area where the first abnormal cells began to develop.”
      </p>
      <p>Maryland followed the national trend, with diagnoses of stage 1 breast cancer rising almost four percentage points from 37.2 percent to 40.8 percent after the Affordable Care Act went into effect in 2010.</p>

    <p>Garza said this is because “removing that financial barrier allowed those women to get screened earlier and as a result of that they’re being detected at an earlier stage that’s treatable.”</p>
    <p>A woman has the best chance of surviving breast cancer when it’s detected early.</p>
    <p>“It became an issue of: Are we taking good care of women?” said Patty McLaughlin, former sales manager at Hologic Inc., a company that sells mammography machines.</p>
    <p>“There was a lot of protest in D.C. that happened right exactly at the time the Affordable Care Act was being written and signed. And as a result, there’s some provisions in the Affordable Care Act about protecting a woman’s right to be screened for breast cancer,” said McLaughlin. </p>
    <p>Black women in particular used to be among those who had lower mammography rates than white women.</p>
    <p>Susan G. Komen, formerly the Susan G. Komen Foundation, says “black women and white women now have about the same rates of mammography use.”
    </p>
    <p>Data from a 2015-2016 American Cancer Society survey found that in 2013, 40-year-old black and white women had mammograms that past year at 52.6 and 52.1 percent respectively.</p>
    <p>For young black women, this rate is crucial for finding stage 1 breast cancers because they are more aggressive.</p>
    <p>Hampton said that in younger black women, the standard course of treatment at her hospital after a stage 1 diagnosis is a lumpectomy or mastectomy because the cancers are so dangerous.</p>
    <p>“When you look stage for stage, a stage 1 breast cancer in those really young African-American women is not similar to a stage 1 breast cancer in an older white woman,” said Hampton.</p>
    <p>Higher rates of black women are diagnosed with more aggressive forms of cancer, Garza said.</p>

    <p>Changes in technology also contributed to the increase in stage 1 diagnoses.</p>
    <p>Three-D mammography, or 3-D tomosynthesis, was approved for use in 2011 according to McLaughlin, and became popular at the same time the ACA’s preventive service component started.</p>
    <p>The new technology allows doctors to examine dense breast tissue “three millimeter slice by three millimeter slice … as opposed to 2-D which was what was traditionally mammography,” said McLaughlin.</p>
    <p> That means more cancers can be found earlier.</p>
    <p>“Three-D mammography is picking up a lot more stage 1 cancers than in the past,” said Dr. Hannah Kim, breast imaging radiologist at Washington Radiology Associates.</p>
    <p> But it is not covered by every insurance carrier under the ACA’s preventive service mandate.</p>
    <p>“I think all of us in the breast world think 3-D should be covered because the 3-D is really the new standard and it just gives us a better picture. We’re able to find and diagnose 20 percent more cancers at earlier stages. It’s like a no-brainer,” Hampton said.</p>

          <p>Mammography became the industry standard for indentifying breast cancer in the 80's and the number of identified invasive breast cancers increased.</p>
          <p>But this wasn't because more women had cancer: it was because better technology meant doctors could catch more cancers, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program said.</p>
          <p>With the growing use of 3-D tomosynthesis, there could be another spike in diagnosis rates in the coming years.</p>

      <p>A repeal of the ACA could jeopardize a woman’s chance to get a mammogram, doctors say.</p>
      <p>“For the uninsured, the people that are on the Obamacare plans, I think it would affect them a lot if they don’t have any back-up plan,” Kim said.</p>
      <p>Garza said that if the Affordable Care Act were repealed, screening rates “would go down. … Because the ACA, the biggest thing they have is the provision of preventative services and pre-existing conditions, which is cancer care.”</p>
      <p>For those without insurance, a mammogram in Maryland isn’t cheap.</p>
      <p>Kim said that if she didn’t have health insurance, a mammogram would cost somewhere between $200 to $300.</p>
      <p>Garza said women who forgo the screenings do so because they’re “trying to survive. It’s not that health is not important to them. … They have other competing priorities that sometimes the last thing they think about is themselves.”</p>
